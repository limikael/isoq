## Head

A React component that inserts its children into the `<head>` of the rendered page.
The component can be placed anywhere inside your component tree, and its children
will always be rendered in the document `<head>`. This allows dynamic modification of
the document head from any part of the UI, such as setting titles, meta tags, or links
in a context-aware way.

Note: The children should be valid head elements and serializable for SSR if used on the server.

### Parameters

*   `props` **[Object][4]** Component props.

    *   `props.children` **React.ReactNode** Elements to insert inside the document `<head>`.

### Examples

```javascript
<Head>
  <title>My Page</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Example page" />
</Head>
```

Returns **JSX.Element** A React component that performs a side effect by modifying the document head.

## useIsoMemo

An isomorphic memoization hook for asynchronous computations. The value returned by `asyncFn`
is generated on the server during SSR and immediately available on the client, avoiding extra fetches.

On the client, `asyncFn` is "debounced" in the sense that only one active call will be in-flight
at any given time. If the hook is called again while a previous call is still pending, it will
return the last known value until the new result arrives.

Note: The returned value must be serializable (plain objects, arrays, primitives),
not class instances or functions.

### Parameters

*   `deps` **[Array][5]\<any>** Dependency array; the function re-runs whenever any dependency changes. (optional, default `[]`)
*   `options` **[Object][4]** Optional settings. (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `options.shared` **[boolean][6]** Whether the memoized value is shared across all clients. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `options.swr` **[boolean][6]** Enables Stale-While-Refresh: returns the old value immediately
        while fetching the new one in the background. (optional, default `false`)

Returns **any** The memoized value, automatically synchronized between server and client.

## useIsoRef

Returns an isomorphic ref whose value is preserved from server to client.

Isomorphic References let a component keep the same value on both the server and the client.
Unlike normal refs, which only exist on the client, an isomorphic ref is filled during server
rendering and automatically available when the page loads on the client.
This makes it easy to share data across environments without extra network calls.
Note: the value must be serializableâ€”only plain JavaScript objects, arrays, and
primitives are supported, not class instances or functions.

### Parameters

*   `initialValue` **any** The initial value for the ref. Can be anything.
*   `options` **[Object][4]** Optional configuration object. (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `options.shared` **[boolean][6]** Whether the value should actually be shared between server and client. (optional, default `true`)

Returns **{current: any}** A ref object whose `.current` value is preserved isomorphically.
