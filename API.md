## Head

A React component that inserts its children into the `<head>` of the rendered page.
The component can be placed anywhere inside your component tree, and its children
will always be rendered in the document `<head>`. This allows dynamic modification of
the document head from any part of the UI, such as setting titles, meta tags, or links
in a context-aware way.

Note: The children should be valid head elements and serializable for SSR if used on the server.

### Parameters

*   `props` **[Object][14]** Component props.

    *   `props.children` **React.ReactNode** Elements to insert inside the document `<head>`.

### Examples

```javascript
<Head>
  <title>My Page</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Example page" />
</Head>
```

Returns **JSX.Element** A React component that performs a side effect by modifying the document head.

## IsoSuspense

`IsoSuspense` works like React’s built-in `Suspense`, but it is aware
of isomorphic references created with [useIsoRef][8].

Normally, when a component suspends and React retries rendering,
the local hook state may be reset. `IsoSuspense` ensures that
`useIsoRef` values are preserved across suspends, so data passed
from the server to the client is not lost during retry renders.

You can wrap any async-loading components in `IsoSuspense`
and provide a fallback UI, just like with normal `Suspense`.

### Parameters

*   `props` **[object][14]**&#x20;

    *   `props.children` **React.ReactNode** The UI subtree that may suspend.
    *   `props.fallback` **React.ReactNode** What to show while waiting.

### Examples

```javascript
<IsoSuspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <UserProfile />
</IsoSuspense>
```

## Link

A navigation component that behaves like a standard `<a>` element,
but intercepts clicks on **local links** (within the same site) to
prevent a full page reload.

This allows client-side navigation while still falling back to
default browser behavior for external URLs.

### Parameters

*   `props` **[Object][14]**&#x20;

    *   `props.href` **[string][15]** The URL to navigate to.
    *   `props.to` **[string][15]** Alias for href.
    *   `props.props` **[Object][14]?** Any other props are passed directly to the underlying `<a>`.
    *   `props.children` **React.ReactNode** The link text or elements.

### Examples

```javascript
// Navigate internally without reloading the page
<Link href="/about">About Us</Link>
```

```javascript
// External link behaves like a normal <a>
<Link href="https://example.com">External Site</Link>
```

Returns **JSX.Element** A link element with client-side navigation for local URLs.

## Route

`Route` conditionally renders its children based on the current URL path.

The `path` prop can include wildcards:

*   `*` matches a single path segment.
*   `**` matches any number of trailing segments.

When navigation happens via [Link][3], if the target route suspends,
the current `Route` will remain visible until the new route is ready.
This avoids showing a blank screen during page transitions.

### Parameters

*   `props` **[object][14]**&#x20;

    *   `props.path` **[string][15]** The path pattern to match (supports `*` and `**`).
    *   `props.children` **React.ReactNode** The UI to render when the path matches.

### Examples

```javascript
<Route path="/about">
  <AboutPage />
</Route>

<Route path="/blog/*">
  <BlogPost />
</Route>

<Route path="/docs/**">
  <Docs />
</Route>
```

## useIsLoading

`useIsoLoading` is a hook that tells you whether there are any
asynchronous operations currently pending during isomorphic rendering.

It returns `true` if the app is waiting on a Suspense boundary or
an async computation from `useIsoMemo`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

This can be useful for rendering global indicators (like a loading bar
or spinner) while parts of the UI are still resolving data.

### Examples

```javascript
function LoadingIndicator() {
  const isLoading = useIsoLoading();

  return isLoading ? <div className="spinner" /> : null;
}
```

Returns **[boolean][16]** Whether there are active loading operations.

## useIsoFetch

`useIsoFetch` returns a function that behaves like the standard
`fetch`, but with special handling for server-side environments.

On the client, it is simply an alias for the global `fetch`.

On the server:

*   For **same-origin requests**, it will directly call into the
    current server’s request handler instead of sending an HTTP request.
    This avoids issues in environments like Cloudflare Workers,
    where a worker cannot make a network request to itself.
*   For **cross-origin requests**, it falls back to the normal `fetch`.

Unlike the built-in `fetch`, this function also supports using
**origin-relative URLs** such as `/api/users/123`. These will resolve
correctly against the application’s origin in both server and client
environments.

From the programmer’s perspective, you can use it just like `fetch`,
without needing to worry about whether the code runs on the client,
the server, or under special hosting restrictions.

### Examples

```javascript
function UserProfile({ id }) {
  const isoFetch = useIsoFetch();

  async function load() {
    const res = await isoFetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
    const user = await res.json();
    console.log(user.name);
  }

  useEffect(() => { load(); }, []);

  return <div>Loading user...</div>;
}
```

## useIsoMemo

An isomorphic memoization hook for asynchronous computations. The value returned by `asyncFn`
is generated on the server during SSR and immediately available on the client, avoiding extra fetches.

On the client, `asyncFn` is "debounced" in the sense that only one active call will be in-flight
at any given time. If the hook is called again while a previous call is still pending, it will
return the last known value until the new result arrives.

Note: The returned value must be serializable (plain objects, arrays, primitives),
not class instances or functions.

### Parameters

*   `asyncFn` **[Function][17]** The asynchronous function whose result should be memoized.
*   `deps` **[Array][18]\<any>** Dependency array; the function re-runs whenever any dependency changes. (optional, default `[]`)
*   `options` **[Object][14]** Optional settings. (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `options.shared` **[boolean][16]** Whether the memoized value is shared across all clients. (optional, default `true`)
    *   `options.swr` **[boolean][16]** Enables Stale-While-Refresh: returns the old value immediately
        while fetching the new one in the background. (optional, default `false`)
    *   `options.hydrate` **[Function][17]?** Optional post-processing function. Receives the memoized value
        and returns a transformed result. `hydrate` is executed on both
        server and client, even when `asyncFn` itself is not re-run.
        Useful for restoring prototypes, adding methods, or normalizing
        data after deserialization.

Returns **any** The memoized value, automatically synchronized between server and client.

## useIsoRef

Returns an isomorphic ref whose value is preserved from server to client.

Isomorphic References let a component keep the same value on both the server and the client.
Unlike normal refs, which only exist on the client, an isomorphic ref is filled during server
rendering and automatically available when the page loads on the client.
This makes it easy to share data across environments without extra network calls.
Note: the value must be serializable—only plain JavaScript objects, arrays, and
primitives are supported, not class instances or functions.

### Parameters

*   `initialValue` **any** The initial value for the ref. Can be anything.
*   `options` **[Object][14]** Optional configuration object. (optional, default `{}`)

    *   `options.shared` **[boolean][16]** Whether the value should actually be shared between server and client. (optional, default `true`)

Returns **{current: any}** A ref object whose `.current` value is preserved isomorphically.

## useIsSsr

`useIsSsr` tells you whether the current render is happening on the server.

This is useful if you need to branch logic between server-side rendering (SSR)
and client-side rendering. For example, you might want to avoid using
browser-only APIs during SSR.

### Examples

```javascript
function PlatformInfo() {
  const isSsr = useIsSsr();
  return <div>{isSsr ? "Server render" : "Client render"}</div>;
}
```

Returns **[boolean][16]** `true` if rendering on the server, otherwise `false`.

## useRedirect

`useRedirect` provides a function for programmatic navigation.

It works like using a [Link][3], but instead of rendering a link,
you call the returned function directly to change the URL.

This is useful for cases where navigation should happen in response
to an event (such as after form submission or button click) rather
than through a visible link.

When called, the function will update the current URL and trigger
route matching. If the target route suspends, the current page will
remain visible until the new one is ready (the same behavior as with `Link`).

### Examples

```javascript
function LoginForm() {
  const redirect = useRedirect();

  async function handleLogin() {
    await loginUser();
    redirect("/dashboard");
  }

  return <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>;
}
```

## useRouteArgs

`useRouteArgs` returns the dynamic arguments captured by wildcards
in the current route’s `path`.

For example, with a route path of `/blog/*` and a URL of `/blog/hello`,
`useRouteArgs()` will return `["hello"]`.

With `/docs/**` and `/docs/guides/setup/install`, it will return
`["guides", "setup", "install"]`.

This is useful for building dynamic pages without needing a full
parameterized router.

### Examples

```javascript
<Route path="/blog/*">
  <BlogPost />
</Route>

function BlogPost() {
  const [slug] = useRouteArgs();
  return <div>Post slug: {slug}</div>;
}
```

Returns **[Array][18]<[string][15]>** An array of matched wildcard segments.

## useRouteLocation

`useRouteLocation` is a hook that provides the current location,
similar to `window.location`, but adapted for isomorphic navigation.

During a navigation triggered by [Link][3], React may keep rendering
the previous page while the new page is still loading (for example,
if the new route suspends). In this case:

*   Components from the **old route** will continue to receive the
    **previous location** value, so they remain consistent while still visible.
*   Components in the **new route** will see the **new target location**
    immediately, even if they are not yet fully rendered.

This ensures that both the outgoing and incoming routes see a
"sensible" location value, avoiding inconsistencies during
transitions and loading states.

### Examples

```javascript
function ShowPath() {
  const location = useRouteLocation();
  return <div>Current path: {location}</div>;
}
```

Returns **[string][15]** The currently rendered url.

## useRouteParams

`useRouteParams` is a convenience hook for accessing query parameters
from the current URL.

Internally it calls [useRouteLocation][12], then parses the
query string and returns all parameters as an object.

### Examples

```javascript
// For /search?q=react&page=2
function SearchPage() {
  const params = useRouteParams();
  return (
    <div>
      Searching for: {params.q}, page {params.page}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Returns **[Object][14]<[string][15], [string][15]>** An object mapping query parameter
names to values. If a parameter appears multiple times, only the
last value is returned.
